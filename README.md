# BOSSxPlanck

Joint analysis of BOSS RSD and BOSSxPlanck CMB Lensing using
perturbation theory.

We use the Cobaya framework for cosmological inference:

https://cobaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

with the likelihood modules in the 'gxk_likelihood' and 'rsd_likelihood' directories.


The theory model is based on velocileptors:

https://github.com/sfschen/velocileptors

and is emulated using Taylor series expansion via the code in the 'emulator' directory.
